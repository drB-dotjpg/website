        <p>I'm a passionate software developer who is always looking to take the next step to hone my skills to become both a quality programmer and a well-rounded person.</p>
        <p>Recently graduating from Iowa State University, I'm currently seeking my first full-time position in software development. During this time, I'm filling my time with freelance work and projects in order to continue becoming the best programmer I can be. Most of this work takes place in the world of esports, since I've made a name for myself there.</p>
        <p>I have over 2 years in front-end development experience, with a focus on React and Vue. I have skills in UX design and in creating accessible experiences for all users. I have experience in back-end development through Python, Java, and C# too. While I'm strong with frontend development, I have my sights set on becoming a full-stack developer and I'm seeking work that will train me and take me to that level.</p>
