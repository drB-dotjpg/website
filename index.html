        <card-grid list="Communication, Teamwork, Project Management, Research"></card-grid>
        <expanding-content class="box">
            <p>During the summer of 2023, I interned with ISU's Center for Industrial Research and Service, or CIRAS for
                short. They aim to help small to medium-sized Iowa-based businesses grow by engaging, educating, and
                embedding.</p>
            <p>My role in my internship was varied:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>I researched a potential "management systems" service that CIRAS could provide customers. My mentor
                    knew there was a demand for something like this, but she needed to learn more about the field. I
                    began my research here, examining what and how numerous consulting firms would serve in this field.
                    I had to combine my knowledge of management information systems and data on how consulting firms
                    would assist in the space. At the end of my internship, I presented the data to leaders at CIRAS.
                </li>
                <li>I collaborated on a project with a client and other interns to help them identify system
                    requirements for a potential project. The process started with a tour one of our mentors took before
                    the summer. He wrote down rough notes during the tour and needed us to clean them up. Once we did
                    that, we sent the notes to the clients to ensure they looked accurate. After communicating what
                    needs to be adjusted, we took the finalized info. We created process map diagrams to present where
                    the client may have shortcomings in their processes.</li>
                <li>The other interns and I had an opportunity with the same company to drive up and conduct a tour
                    ourselves. We took this tour to solidify our process maps and see the process for ourselves instead
                    of just relying on emails. After the tour, we presented the process maps with the company's
                    employees to do one final check. After the tour, we had accurate diagrams and could move forward to
                    start making recommendations to adjust shortcomings.</li>
                <li>The other interns and I took extensive business tours to learn more about how companies around Iowa
                    operate. We visited Arcosa Wind Towers in Newton, Vermeer in Pella, Bunn in Creston, and Collins
                    Aerospace in Ames and Cedar Rapids. I learned a lot about how businesses operated, especially in
                    industry, which was a weak point in my knowledge.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I accepted this internship intending to improve the management side of my management info systems degree.
                Finishing the internship, I felt more well-balanced with newfound skills in business-to-business
                communication and an overall understanding of how businesses operate.</p>

            attempting to learn a new game engine in 24 hours. While we didn't succeed in learning that, we did shift
            our focus on making a meaningful game proposal, which was still within scope for the Game Jam. Thanks to
            this identification and shift of priorities, our proposal got cited as 'thoughtful inclusion of social

            <p>In May 2023, I was hired by an esports production company named Level1 to work on an event they needed
                extra hands with. The event was called Battle Of BC 5, a major tournament for a game called Super Smash
                Bros. My job was to create the graphics for the livestream. The graphics are powered off a "web browser
                source" in their livestream software, so they were written using Typescript, Lit, and CSS.</p>
            <p>I was provided with graphics concepts created by a designer. However, I still had to replicate the
                designs in HTML and CSS while plugging in reactive data (e.g., scoreboard data, player names) to a
                dashboard app connected to a web server. In the end, I created about 13 different graphics for the
                event's stream.</p>

                contributed to the backend, but my main work with this project was the frontend. To keep things simple
                for my teammates, and remain within the scope of the project, I've opted to use basic
                HTML/CSS/Javascript to avoid needing to build. I did take advantage of Flask's html templating features
                to create components.</p>
            <p>This project earned extra credit for being the best in the class. My professor also thought I used React
                for the frontend during our demo, which I found funny and flattering.</p>

                featuring quality match-ups, the best casters, and a detail-packed stream.</p>
            <p>This series is the most advanced Livestream production I've created to date. It features flashy

            <p><a href="https://maps.iplabs.ink/">maps.iplabs.ink</a> is a web tool I've created to help people in the
                competitive Splatoon scene. The game has four modes and dozens of stages you can play on. Each stage can
                be played on any mode, so many different map mode combos need to be handled in our tournaments. The goal
                of
                this site is to automate the creation of map lists for tournament play. The challenge was to create map
                lists that contained an equal amount of maps and modes that seemed varied and kept the site as easy to
                use
                as possible.</p>

            <p>To help boost social media engagement for our esports events, I've created a discord bot that can quickly
                turn a Twitch clip into an mp4 file with our logos and link to view added to the bottom of clips
                automatically. With this tool, we can post clips from our livestream to our social media pages in about
                one minute. The tool can also create graphics automatically based on info the user provides.</p>
