            During the summer of 2023, I held an internship with ISU's Center for Industrial Research and Service. Their
            goal is to help small to medium sized businesses grow by engaging, educating, and embedding.<br>
            My role in my internship was varied. First, I conducted research for a potential “management systems”
            service that CIRAS could provide to customers. Next, I collaborated on a project with a client and other
            interns to help them identify system requirements for a potential project. Third, I had an opportunity to
            drive to a business and take a tour to understand their processes with the goal of assisting them with
            processes mapping. Last, me and the other interns had the privilege of taking extensive business tours to
            learn more about how companies around Iowa operate.<br>
            I accepted this internship with the goal of improving the management side of my management info systems
            degree. Finishing the internship, I felt more well balanced with newfound skills in business to business
            communication and an overall understanding of how businesses operate.

            In May 2023, I was hired by an esports production company named Level1 to work on an event they needed extra
            hands with. The event was called Battle Of BC 5, a major tournament for a game called Super Smash Bros. My
            job was to create the graphics for the livestream. The graphics are powered off a “web browser source” in
            their livestream software, so all the graphics were written using Typescript, Lit, and CSS.<br>
            I was provided graphics concepts created by a designer, but I still had to replicate the designs in HTML and
            CSS while plugging in reactive data (eg. scoreboard data, player names, etc.) to a dashboard app connected
            to a web server. I created about 13 different graphics for the event's stream in the end.

            Game jams are challenges where you are given a set amount of time to create a game. The prompt for this game
            jam was “Games for Change”. I worked with a team of fellow ISU students to create a video game while
            attempting to learn a new game engine in 24 hours. While we didn't succeed in learning that, we did shift
            our focus on making a meaningful game proposal, which was still within scope for the Game Jam. Thanks to
            this identification and shift of priorities, our proposal got cited as 'thoughtful inclusion of social
            impact' and gave us the potential to further our game's development.

            welcome to join the event, hosted in the ISU gaming and esports room. People are encouraged to donate
            through fun incentives!<br>
            For 2023, we ran a 2 day stream with half the stream online and the other half in the ISU gaming and esports
            room. Alongside the graphics all coded by me using javascript, I was in charge of handing tech for getting
            donations on stream and getting people's computer feed to the stream using an RTMP server. By the end, we
            raised $5,445.69 for Games For Love.
