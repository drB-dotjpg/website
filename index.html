        <card-grid list="Communication, Teamwork, Project Management, Research"></card-grid>
        <expanding-content class="box">
            <p>During the summer of 2023, I interned with ISU's Center for Industrial Research and Service, or CIRAS for
                short. They aim to help small to medium-sized Iowa-based businesses grow by engaging, educating, and
                embedding.</p>
            <p>My role in my internship was varied:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>I researched a potential "management systems" service that CIRAS could provide customers. My mentor
                    knew there was a demand for something like this, but she needed to learn more about the field. I
                    began my research here, examining what and how numerous consulting firms would serve in this field.
                    I had to combine my knowledge of management information systems and data on how consulting firms
                    would assist in the space. At the end of my internship, I presented the data to leaders at CIRAS.
                </li>
                <li>I collaborated on a project with a client and other interns to help them identify system
                    requirements for a potential project. The process started with a tour one of our mentors took before
                    the summer. He wrote down rough notes during the tour and needed us to clean them up. Once we did
                    that, we sent the notes to the clients to ensure they looked accurate. After communicating what
                    needs to be adjusted, we took the finalized info. We created process map diagrams to present where
                    the client may have shortcomings in their processes.</li>
                <li>The other interns and I had an opportunity with the same company to drive up and conduct a tour
                    ourselves. We took this tour to solidify our process maps and see the process for ourselves instead
                    of just relying on emails. After the tour, we presented the process maps with the company's
                    employees to do one final check. After the tour, we had accurate diagrams and could move forward to
                    start making recommendations to adjust shortcomings.</li>
                <li>The other interns and I took extensive business tours to learn more about how companies around Iowa
                    operate. We visited Arcosa Wind Towers in Newton, Vermeer in Pella, Bunn in Creston, and Collins
                    Aerospace in Ames and Cedar Rapids. I learned a lot about how businesses operated, especially in
                    industry, which was a weak point in my knowledge.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I accepted this internship intending to improve the management side of my management info systems degree.
                Finishing the internship, I felt more well-balanced with newfound skills in business-to-business
                communication and an overall understanding of how businesses operate.</p>

            <p>In May 2023, I was hired by an esports production company named Level1 to work on an event they needed
                extra hands with. The event was called Battle Of BC 5, a major tournament for a game called Super Smash
                Bros. My job was to create the graphics for the livestream. The graphics are powered off a "web browser
                source" in their livestream software, so they were written using Typescript, Lit, and CSS.</p>
            <p>I was provided with graphics concepts created by a designer. However, I still had to replicate the
                designs in HTML and CSS while plugging in reactive data (e.g., scoreboard data, player names) to a
                dashboard app connected to a web server. In the end, I created about 13 different graphics for the
                event's stream.</p>
            <p>This project taught me a lot about web development, even if it's an unconventional web app. It also
                taught me a lot of excellent practices with collaborative coding and using git on a large project. We
                even had a virtual kanban board to determine who works on what and to help us identify what needs to be
                worked on.</p>

            I work at ISU for the School of Journalism's IT department during school. My main job is to assist wherever

            other times, I have to provide technical support to the numerous computer labs around the building and
            support faculty with various tech problems. During my time in this position, I've learned some foundational
            skills in IT. That includes our ticketing system, general troubleshooting, and working well with people who

            Game jams are challenges where you are given a set amount of time to create a game. The prompt for this game
            jam was “Games for Change”. I worked with a team of fellow ISU students to create a video game while
            attempting to learn a new game engine in 24 hours. While we didn't succeed in learning that, we did shift
            our focus on making a meaningful game proposal, which was still within scope for the Game Jam. Thanks to
            this identification and shift of priorities, our proposal got cited as 'thoughtful inclusion of social
            impact' and gave us the potential to further our game's development.
