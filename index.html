        <h2 class="font-syne flex">CIRAS <span class="label font-mono">Summer Internship</span></h2>
        <p class="box">
            During the summer of 2023, I held an internship with ISU's Center for Industrial Research and Service. Their
            goal is to help small to medium sized businesses grow by engaging, educating, and embedding.<br>
            My role in my internship was varied. First, I conducted research for a potential “management systems”
            service that CIRAS could provide to customers. Next, I collaborated on a project with a client and other
            interns to help them identify system requirements for a potential project. Third, I had an opportunity to
            drive to a business and take a tour to understand their processes with the goal of assisting them with
            processes mapping. Last, me and the other interns had the privilege of taking extensive business tours to
            learn more about how companies around Iowa operate.<br>
            I accepted this internship with the goal of improving the management side of my management info systems
            degree. Finishing the internship, I felt more well balanced with newfound skills in business to business
            communication and an overall understanding of how businesses operate.

        <h2 class="font-syne flex">Level1 <span class="label font-mono">Freelance Work</span></h2>
        <p class="box">
            In May 2023, I was hired by an esports production company named Level1 to work on an event they needed extra hands with. The event was called Battle Of BC 5, a major tournament for a game called Super Smash Bros. My job was to create the graphics for the livestream. The graphics are powered off a “web browser source” in their livestream software, so all the graphics were written using Typescript, Lit, and CSS.<br>
            I was provided graphics concepts created by a designer, but I still had to replicate the designs in HTML and CSS while plugging in reactive data (eg. scoreboard data, player names, etc.) to a dashboard app connected to a web server. I created about 13 different graphics for the event's stream in the end.

        <h2 class="font-syne flex">Greenlee Student Tech <span class="label font-mono">On Campus Work</span></h2>
        <p class="box">
            During school, I work at ISU for the school of journalism's IT department. My main job is to provide assistance wherever needed around the building. Most of the time, that involves checking out camera equipment to students. But other times, I have to provide technical support to the numerous computer labs around the building and support faculty with various tech problems.
